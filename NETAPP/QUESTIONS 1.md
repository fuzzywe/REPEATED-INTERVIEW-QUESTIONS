 Find square root of an integer
You are given a positive integer ‘N’. Your task is to find and return its square root. If ‘N’ is not a perfect square, then return the floor value of sqrt(N).

Here are the **brute-force**, **better**, and **optimal** solutions for finding the square root of an integer \(N\) in **C++**:

### **1. Brute Force Solution**  
**Approach:**
- Increment `i` starting from `1` until `i * i > N`.  
- The largest `i` for which `i * i <= N` is the floor of the square root.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int squareRootBrute(int N) {
    int i = 1;
    while (i * i <= N) {
        i++;
    }
    return i - 1;
}

int main() {
    cout << squareRootBrute(16) << endl;  // Output: 4
    cout << squareRootBrute(10) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **2. Better Solution (Binary Search)**  
**Approach:**
- Apply binary search between `1` and `N / 2`.  
- Update `mid` and adjust the range based on the condition `mid * mid <= N`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int squareRootBinarySearch(int N) {
    if (N == 0 || N == 1) return N;
    int low = 1, high = N, ans = 0;
    
    while (low <= high) {
        long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (mid * mid == N)
            return mid;
        else if (mid * mid < N) {
            ans = mid;
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    cout << squareRootBinarySearch(16) << endl;  // Output: 4
    cout << squareRootBinarySearch(10) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **3. Optimal Solution (Newton-Raphson Method)**  
**Approach:**  
- Start with an initial guess and iteratively improve the approximation.  
- `x = (x + N / x) / 2` until convergence.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int squareRootNewton(int N) {
    double x = N;
    double root;
    while (true) {
        root = 0.5 * (x + N / x);
        if (abs(root - x) < 1) break;
        x = root;
    }
    return (int)root;
}

int main() {
    cout << squareRootNewton(16) << endl;  // Output: 4
    cout << squareRootNewton(10) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

Q4. Implement strstr() function in C
You are given two strings A and B. Find the index of the first occurrence of A in B. If A is not present in B, then return -1.
For Example:
A = “bc”, B = “abcddbc”. String “A” is present at index 1, and 5(0-based index), but we will return 1 as it is the first occurrence of “A” in string “B”.
Here's how you can implement the `strstr()` function in **C** to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring \( A \) in a string \( B \). If \( A \) is not found, return `-1`.

### **Approach**
- Loop through each character of string \( B \).  
- Check if the substring starting at each position matches string \( A \).  
- Return the index immediately upon finding the first match.

### **Code (C)**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int strstrCustom(const char *A, const char *B) {
    int lenA = strlen(A);
    int lenB = strlen(B);
    
    if (lenA == 0) return 0;  // Empty string A is found at index 0 by definition
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= lenB - lenA; i++) {
        int j;
        for (j = 0; j < lenA; j++) {
            if (B[i + j] != A[j]) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (j == lenA) {
            return i;  // Found match at index i
        }
    }
    return -1;  // No match found
}

int main() {
    const char *A = "bc";
    const char *B = "abcddbc";
    
    int result = strstrCustom(A, B);
    printf("The first occurrence of \"%s\" in \"%s\" is at index: %d\n", A, B, result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation**
1. `strlen(A)` and `strlen(B)` calculate the lengths of strings \( A \) and \( B \).
2. We loop from `0` to `lenB - lenA` to avoid going out of bounds.
3. The inner loop checks character by character if substring \( A \) matches part of \( B \).
4. If `j == lenA`, it means the whole substring matches, and we return the starting index.
5. If no match is found, return `-1`.

### **Time Complexity**
- **Best case:** O(lenA) — when a match is found at the beginning.  
- **Worst case:** O(lenA * lenB) — when no match is found.

This approach is simple, but for larger inputs or repeated search patterns, more advanced algorithms like **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)** or **Rabin-Karp** could be used.


These solutions cover multiple approaches with different complexities for better understanding and optimization.

Here’s how to implement **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** and **Rabin-Karp (RK)** algorithms for solving the `strstr()` function in **C**.

---

### **1. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**
The **KMP** algorithm preprocesses the pattern \( A \) to build a longest prefix suffix (LPS) array that helps skip unnecessary comparisons.

#### **Code (C)**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void computeLPSArray(const char *A, int lenA, int *lps) {
    int length = 0;
    lps[0] = 0;  // LPS[0] is always 0
    int i = 1;
    
    while (i < lenA) {
        if (A[i] == A[length]) {
            length++;
            lps[i] = length;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (length != 0) {
                length = lps[length - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
}

int strstrKMP(const char *A, const char *B) {
    int lenA = strlen(A);
    int lenB = strlen(B);
    if (lenA == 0) return 0;
    
    int lps[lenA];
    computeLPSArray(A, lenA, lps);
    
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < lenB) {
        if (A[j] == B[i]) {
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        
        if (j == lenA) {
            return i - j;  // Found the match
        } else if (i < lenB && A[j] != B[i]) {
            if (j != 0) {
                j = lps[j - 1];
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    const char *A = "bc";
    const char *B = "abcddbc";
    
    int result = strstrKMP(A, B);
    printf("KMP: The first occurrence of \"%s\" in \"%s\" is at index: %d\n", A, B, result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **2. Rabin-Karp (RK) Algorithm**
The **Rabin-Karp** algorithm uses a rolling hash to match substrings efficiently.

#### **Code (C)**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define PRIME 101

int createHash(const char *str, int len) {
    int hash = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        hash = hash * 256 + str[i];
        hash %= PRIME;
    }
    return hash;
}

int recalculateHash(const char *str, int oldIndex, int newIndex, int oldHash, int patternLen) {
    oldHash = (oldHash - str[oldIndex] * 256 * (patternLen - 1)) % PRIME;
    oldHash = (oldHash * 256 + str[newIndex]) % PRIME;
    if (oldHash < 0) {
        oldHash += PRIME;
    }
    return oldHash;
}

int strstrRK(const char *A, const char *B) {
    int lenA = strlen(A);
    int lenB = strlen(B);
    if (lenA > lenB) return -1;

    int patternHash = createHash(A, lenA);
    int textHash = createHash(B, lenA);
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= lenB - lenA; i++) {
        if (patternHash == textHash && strncmp(B + i, A, lenA) == 0) {
            return i;  // Found the match
        }
        if (i < lenB - lenA) {
            textHash = recalculateHash(B, i, i + lenA, textHash, lenA);
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    const char *A = "bc";
    const char *B = "abcddbc";
    
    int result = strstrRK(A, B);
    printf("Rabin-Karp: The first occurrence of \"%s\" in \"%s\" is at index: %d\n", A, B, result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of Algorithms**
1. **KMP**  
   - Uses an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array to skip redundant comparisons.  
   - Time Complexity: **O(lenA + lenB)**.  
   - Space Complexity: **O(lenA)** for LPS array.

2. **Rabin-Karp**  
   - Computes a hash value for substring comparisons to detect matches efficiently.  
   - Time Complexity: **O(lenA + lenB)** on average, but can be **O(lenA * lenB)** in worst-case (with hash collisions).  
   - Space Complexity: **O(1)** (rolling hash).

These efficient algorithms provide different approaches to solving substring search problems depending on the context and input characteristics.


To find the **maximum** number from a stream of **1 million numbers** with constraints:

- Numbers are entered **one-by-one** (first case).
- Numbers are provided **1000 at a time** (second case).

Here’s how to handle both scenarios efficiently.

---
**have a million numbers, how will u find the maximum number from them if → the input is given on the fly i.e. the numbers are entered one by one. → numbers are given 1000 at a time**

### **1. One-by-One Input (Streaming Input)**
#### Approach:
- Maintain a variable `maxNum` initialized to a very small value (e.g., `INT_MIN` in C/C++).
- Iterate through the numbers as they are given one at a time.
- Update `maxNum` if the current number is larger.

#### Pseudo-Code (for single-stream input):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num, maxNum = INT_MIN;  // Initialize maxNum to smallest possible value
    while (cin >> num) {  // Continue until input ends
        if (num > maxNum) {
            maxNum = num;  // Update maxNum if current number is larger
        }
    }
    cout << "Maximum number is: " << maxNum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `cin >> num` takes input until EOF. For real-time streams, data can be processed without waiting for all inputs.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)** (linear scan over all numbers).
- Space Complexity: **O(1)**.

---

### **2. Batch Input (1000 Numbers at a Time)**
#### Approach:
- Process each batch separately, updating the global maximum after processing each batch.
- Maintain a global `maxNum` and update it with the maximum from each batch.

#### Pseudo-Code (for batch input):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int maxNum = INT_MIN;  // Initialize global maximum
    int batchSize = 1000;
    int numbers[batchSize];

    while (true) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < batchSize && cin >> numbers[i]; i++) {
            count++;
        }
        if (count == 0) break;  // Exit loop if no numbers are read

        // Find the maximum in the current batch
        int batchMax = INT_MIN;
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            if (numbers[i] > batchMax) {
                batchMax = numbers[i];
            }
        }
        if (batchMax > maxNum) {
            maxNum = batchMax;  // Update global maximum
        }
    }
    cout << "Maximum number is: " << maxNum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Process `1000` numbers at a time using an array.
- Find the maximum in the batch, then update the global maximum.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)** (linear scan for all numbers, with constant time comparisons).
- Space Complexity: **O(batchSize)**.

---

### **Optimization Considerations**
- **One-Pass Approach**: Regardless of the input format (single or batch), only one pass through the numbers is needed to find the maximum.
- **Memory Efficiency**: In batch input, only one small array of size 1000 is used, making it scalable for very large inputs.

This strategy works efficiently even for **very large streams** or **real-time data processing**.

Uninitialized **static** and **global variables** are stored in the **BSS (Block Started by Symbol) segment** of a program's memory.

### **Memory Segments**
1. **BSS Segment**:
   - Stores **uninitialized** global and static variables.
   - Allocated at program startup but not initialized with any specific value (set to zero by default).
   - Example:
     ```c
     static int count;  // Stored in BSS (initial value is 0)
     int globalVar;     // Stored in BSS (initial value is 0)
     ```

2. **Data Segment**:
   - Stores **initialized** global and static variables.
   - Example:
     ```c
     static int initializedVar = 5;  // Stored in data segment
     int globalInitialized = 10;    // Stored in data segment
     ```

3. **Heap**:
   - Stores dynamically allocated memory (e.g., `malloc` or `new`).

4. **Stack**:
   - Stores local variables and function call-related data.

### **Summary**
| Variable Type        | Memory Segment |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Uninitialized global/static | BSS            |
| Initialized global/static   | Data segment   |
| Local variables        | Stack          |
| Dynamically allocated  | Heap           |

How is the control of program passed from main() to any other function? where is the return address of main stored


When control is passed from `main()` to another function, several steps take place in the **function call mechanism**, involving **stack operations**. The **return address** of `main()` is stored in a specific location to allow proper return control flow.

### **Step-by-Step Flow of Function Call**
1. **Calling a Function from `main()`**:
   - The **return address** (the instruction immediately after the function call) is pushed onto the **call stack**.
   - **Arguments (if any)** to the called function are pushed onto the stack or passed via registers, depending on the system's calling convention.
   - Control transfers to the **entry point** of the called function.

2. **Function Execution**:
   - The function executes its code.
   - Local variables and the function’s stack frame are managed on the stack.

3. **Returning from the Function**:
   - The function finishes execution.
   - The return address is popped from the stack.
   - Control jumps back to the location stored in the return address (the point after the function call in `main()`).

### **Where is the Return Address of `main()` Stored?**
The **return address of `main()`** is stored by the system in a **special location defined by the operating system**, typically in the **call stack** when the program is started by the operating system loader. The stack frame created by the operating system may store it at:
- **Top of the call stack** or
- **Special registers** depending on the system's architecture.

In **most architectures**, when the entire program finishes executing, the return address points back to a system routine (like `_exit`) provided by the runtime environment.

---

### **Summary**
- **Control Transfer**: Via the **call stack** using return addresses.
- **Return Address of `main()`**: Stored on the **stack** or **registers** as managed by the OS and system architecture.
- **Program End**: Return address from `main()` points to system exit routines.

  Operating System Question
In a unix or linux file system, how file path resolved? For example : /root/home/ooo/abc.c

Add your answer

In a **Unix or Linux file system**, the process of **file path resolution** involves multiple steps to locate the file referenced by a path such as `/root/home/ooo/abc.c`. Here's how it works:

---

### **Step-by-Step Path Resolution**

1. **Start at the Root Directory (`/`)**:
   - The path `/root/home/ooo/abc.c` is an **absolute path** because it starts with `/`. The resolution begins from the **root directory**.
   - The root directory (`/`) is represented by an inode (a data structure containing metadata and pointers to data blocks).

2. **Traverse Each Directory in Sequence**:
   - The system resolves each component in the path (`root`, `home`, `ooo`, and finally `abc.c`) one at a time.
   - It starts with looking up the `root` directory in the root's inode.

3. **Directory Entry Lookup**:
   - Each directory (`root`, `home`, `ooo`) contains entries mapping file/directory names to inodes.
   - For example:
     - `/root` is found by reading the entries in the root directory.
     - The inode for `root` is used to find `home`.
     - Similarly, `home` is used to find `ooo`.

4. **Access the Final File**:
   - The last component `abc.c` is located within the `ooo` directory by using its inode and data blocks.
   - The inode for `abc.c` provides the file's metadata and data locations.

5. **File Permission and Access Checks**:
   - During each step, **permission checks** are performed to ensure the user has the right to traverse the directories and access the file.

---

### **Path Components in Detail**
| Path Component   | Description                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/`              | Root directory (starting point for absolute paths). |
| `root`           | First directory within the root, looked up by its inode. |
| `home`           | Subdirectory within `/root`, accessed from `root`’s inode. |
| `ooo`            | Directory within `/root/home`.                |
| `abc.c`          | File within `/root/home/ooo`, located by its inode. |

---

### **Optimization Techniques**
- **Path Caching**: Frequently accessed paths may be cached to avoid repetitive traversals.
- **Symbolic Links and Hard Links**: Resolved by reading link targets for symbolic links, while hard links point to the same inode directly.

### Can You Compare Two Structure Variables in C? Why or Why Not?

No, you **cannot directly compare two structure variables** using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, etc.) in C. This is because:

- Structures in C are **user-defined data types** and may contain various types of members. The language does not provide a built-in way to compare the entire contents of a structure in one step.
- Direct comparison of structure variables is **not supported** since it would require a member-wise comparison of all individual members, which may include pointers, arrays, or other structures.

To compare two structure variables, you must manually compare each member individually:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
struct Point p2 = {1, 2};

if (p1.x == p2.x && p1.y == p2.y) {
    printf("Structures are equal\n");
} else {
    printf("Structures are not equal\n");
}

In an **Operating System (OS) context**, the return value of the `main` function in a C or C++ program (or other languages compiled to native code) is used by the **system** or **parent process** to determine the program's exit status. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Where the Returned Value Goes
1. **Exit Code (Status)**:  
   The value returned by the `main` function is typically passed to the operating system as the program's **exit status**.  
   Example:  
   ```c
   int main() {
       return 0;  // 0 indicates successful completion
   }
   ```
   - The `return` value (`0` in this example) becomes the **exit status** of the program.
   - If `main` does not explicitly return a value, the compiler may insert a default return of `0`.

2. **Usage by Parent Process**:
   - The **parent process** (which invoked the program) retrieves the exit status using a system call like `wait()` or `waitpid()` on Unix-like systems.  
   - In a shell or terminal, this status is stored in a special variable like `$?` in bash.

3. **System Calls for Exit**:
   - On Linux/Unix, the `main` return value is passed to `exit(int status)`.  
   - The `exit` system call (`_exit` or `exit_group`) terminates the process and passes the exit status to the OS.

### Practical Example in Shell
```bash
./myprogram
echo $?  # Prints the exit status of myprogram
```

### Common Exit Code Conventions
- `0`: Success
- Non-zero: Indicates various error conditions or failure codes.

Thus, the return value of `main` is critical for inter-process communication and signaling success or failure to the operating system or invoking processes.
```

### What is Cell Padding in C?

**Cell padding** (also called **structure padding**) is the extra memory added between structure members to align data according to the system’s memory alignment requirements. This happens because most CPUs fetch memory more efficiently when data is aligned to certain byte boundaries (e.g., 4 or 8 bytes).

#### Why Padding is Needed
- To improve **performance** by aligning data to memory boundaries.
- To comply with **hardware requirements** for efficient memory access.

#### Example of Structure Padding
```c
struct Example {
    char a;     // 1 byte
    int b;      // 4 bytes (on a 4-byte boundary)
};

```
In the above example:
- `a` is 1 byte, but `b` is aligned to a 4-byte boundary, so **3 bytes of padding** are added after `a`.

Structure padding leads to larger memory usage, but it ensures faster access to members due to alignment. It is controlled by the compiler, but can be minimized or disabled with compiler-specific pragmas or attributes (though it may reduce performance).

---

### **Conclusion**
File path resolution in Unix/Linux systems involves traversing the directory hierarchy, starting from the root, using inodes and directory entries to find each component, performing permission checks, and finally accessing the file or directory requested.

When you try to access a **null pointer** in C, it typically results in a **runtime error** because null pointers do not reference any valid memory location. Here’s what happens in detail:

### 1. **Null Pointer Definition**:
A null pointer is a pointer that is **explicitly initialized to point to nothing**:
```c
int *ptr = NULL;  // ptr is a null pointer
```

### 2. **Accessing a Null Pointer**:
Attempting to dereference or access a null pointer, like:
```c
int *ptr = NULL;
int value = *ptr;  // Undefined behavior
```
leads to **undefined behavior**. The typical outcomes are:
- **Segmentation fault** (on Unix-like systems): This occurs when the program attempts to read or write memory at address `0x0`, which is protected by the operating system.
- **Access Violation Error** (on Windows): Similar to a segmentation fault, the operating system will terminate the program.

### 3. **Why a Null Pointer Access Fails**:
- **Null is Reserved**: The memory address `0x0` is typically **not mapped** to the program's address space to prevent accidental access.
- **Memory Protection Mechanism**: Operating systems use **virtual memory management** to safeguard access to invalid addresses.

### 4. **Handling Null Pointers Safely**:
Always check for `NULL` before dereferencing:
```c
int *ptr = NULL;
if (ptr != NULL) {
    int value = *ptr;
} else {
    printf("Pointer is null, cannot access.\n");
}
```

### Summary
Accessing a null pointer leads to undefined behavior, typically causing a **segmentation fault or crash**. Safe programming practices involve always checking for null pointers before dereferencing.

### Q22. **What is Internal Fragmentation?**  
**Internal fragmentation** occurs when fixed-sized memory blocks are allocated to processes, but the process does not use all the allocated space, leaving unused memory **within** the allocated block. This wasted space is **internal** to the partition and cannot be used by other processes.

- **Example**: If a process requires 18KB but is allocated a 20KB block, 2KB is wasted as internal fragmentation.

---

### Q23. **What are the Phases of a Compiler?**  
A compiler typically goes through the following **phases**:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Converts the source code into tokens.
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Checks the syntactic structure and generates a parse tree.
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Ensures semantic consistency (e.g., type checking).
4. **Intermediate Code Generation**: Produces an intermediate code (platform-independent).
5. **Code Optimization**: Improves the intermediate code efficiency.
6. **Code Generation**: Produces machine code for the target platform.
7. **Symbol Table Management and Error Handling**: Used throughout for storing identifiers and reporting errors.

### Q24. **What is a Segmentation Fault?**  
A **segmentation fault** occurs when a program tries to access memory that it is not permitted to access or tries to write to a read-only memory location. This is a **common runtime error** in C and C++ programs, often caused by dereferencing null or invalid pointers.

### Q25. **What is an Interrupt?**  
An **interrupt** is a signal to the processor from hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. It causes the processor to **temporarily pause its current task**, handle the interrupt, and then resume.

- **Types of Interrupts**:
  - **Hardware Interrupts**: Triggered by devices like keyboards or disks.
  - **Software Interrupts**: Triggered by programs (e.g., system calls).

### Q26. **What is CSMA Protocol?**  
**CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)** is a network protocol that controls access to a shared transmission medium:

- **Carrier Sense**: A device checks if the medium is free before transmitting.
- **Multiple Access**: Multiple devices share the medium.
  
**Variants**:
- **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**: Used in Ethernet networks to detect collisions.
- **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**: Used in wireless networks to avoid collisions.

### Q30. **What is a System Stack?**

A **system stack** is a data structure used by an operating system and processes to manage **function calls**, **local variables**, and **return addresses** during program execution. It operates on the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle, where the last item added is the first to be removed.

#### Key Characteristics of a System Stack:
1. **Kernel Stack vs. User Stack**:  
   - **Kernel Stack**: Used by the **operating system's kernel** to manage internal operations, such as handling interrupts and system calls. Each kernel thread has its own kernel stack.
   - **User Stack**: Used by user-mode processes for managing function calls and local variables.

2. **Stack Frames**:  
   Each function call creates a **stack frame** containing:
   - **Local variables**
   - **Function parameters**
   - **Return address** (address to return to after the function completes)

3. **Growth**:  
   In most systems, stacks grow **downward** (toward lower memory addresses).

4. **System Stack in Context Switching**:  
   During a context switch, the system saves the current process's **stack pointer** to resume it later.

#### Importance of a System Stack:
- Manages recursive function calls.
- Stores and retrieves data during function invocations.
- Handles **interrupts and exceptions** in kernel mode.

**Example**:
```c
void func() {
    int localVar = 5;  // Stored on the stack
}
```
In this example, `localVar` will be stored on the system stack until `func()` returns.

### Summary
The **system stack** is an essential structure for managing function calls, local variables, and context switches, supporting both user-level and kernel-level operations.

Yes, **multithreading** can be implemented in Python, but with important considerations due to the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**. Here’s an overview of how Python handles multithreading and when to use it.

### **Multithreading in Python**
Python provides the `threading` module to create and manage threads.

#### **Key Components**
1. **Thread Class**: Represents a single thread of control.
2. **Lock, Semaphore**: For thread synchronization and preventing race conditions.

#### **Basic Example of Multithreading**
```python
import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
        time.sleep(1)

def print_letters():
    for letter in 'abcde':
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Create threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Start threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Threads have finished execution.")
```

### **Challenges and Considerations**
- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Python’s GIL allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time per interpreter process. This limits the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks.
  
- **When to Use Multithreading**: 
  - Suitable for **I/O-bound tasks** like file I/O, network requests, and database operations, where threads can wait on external resources.
  - Not efficient for **CPU-bound tasks**. Use `multiprocessing` for true parallelism in CPU-intensive applications.

### **Alternatives for CPU-bound Tasks**
1. **Multiprocessing**: Provides true parallelism using multiple processes, bypassing the GIL.
2. **Asyncio**: For asynchronous programming, useful for handling I/O-bound tasks without blocking.

#### **Example Using Multiprocessing**
```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def compute_square(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        print(f"Square of {number}: {number * number}")

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create and start a separate process
process = Process(target=compute_square, args=(numbers,))
process.start()
process.join()
```

### Summary
- Python supports multithreading with the `threading` module but is limited by the GIL for CPU-bound tasks.
- Use **threading** for I/O-bound tasks and **multiprocessing** or **asyncio** for better parallelism in CPU-intensive workloads.
