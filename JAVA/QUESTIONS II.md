Why is the main method Public in Java?
We know that a method with a public access specifier can be accessed/invoked by anyone. Because the JVM must invoke the main method, it is public in Java. The JVM will not call main() if it is not public in Java.
 
Why is the main method Static and void in Java?
Because the main() method is static, JVM can call it without having to instantiate the class. This also saves memory that would have been wasted if the object had been declared only for the JVM to call the main() method.
Because the main method in Java does not return anything, its return type is void.

What is Method in Java?
A method is a segment of code that only executes when it is invoked. Parameters are data that can be passed into a method. Methods, often known as functions, are used to carry out specific tasks.
 
What do you mean by Recursion?
The technique of making a function call itself is known as recursion. This strategy allows you to break down complex difficulties into more minor, easier-to-solve problems.
 
How many types of Recursion are there?
There are two sorts of recursion: one in which a function calls itself from within itself, and the other in which multiple functions call each other mutually. The first is known as direct recursion, whereas the second is known as indirect recursion.
 
What is an Infinite Loop?
An infinite loop (also known as an endless loop) is a piece of code that continues indefinitely because it lacks a functional exit.
 
What is the critical difference between While and For loop in Java?
The difference between a for loop and a while loop is that in a for loop, the number of iterations to be performed is already known and is used to obtain a particular result, whereas, in a while loop, the command runs until a specific condition is met and the statement is proven untrue.
