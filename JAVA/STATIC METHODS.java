Can we override static methods in Java? Reason

No, you cannot override static methods in Java. The reason for this is that static methods belong to the class itself, rather than to any particular instance of the class. Overriding is a concept that applies to instance methods, where a subclass provides
  a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
  Since static methods are not associated with any instance, the concept of overriding does not apply to them.

However, you can hide a static method in a subclass by defining a static method with the same signature in the subclass. 
  This is known as method hiding. When a static method is hidden, the method in the subclass is called instead of the method in the superclass if the method is invoked on the subclass.

Here's an example to illustrate method hiding:


class SuperClass {
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in SuperClass");
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in SubClass");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SuperClass.staticMethod();  // Output: Static method in SuperClass
        SubClass.staticMethod();    // Output: Static method in SubClass
    }
}
In this example, the staticMethod in the SubClass hides the staticMethod in the SuperClass. When staticMethod is called on SuperClass, the method in SuperClass 
  is executed. When staticMethod is called on SubClass, the method in SubClass is executed.


Overriding: Enables runtime polymorphism, where the method called depends on the object type.
Hiding: Does not enable polymorphism; the method called depends on the class reference used.

To summarize:

Overriding: Applies to instance methods. A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
Hiding: Applies to static methods. A subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in its superclass, effectively hiding the superclass's method.
Understanding the distinction between overriding and hiding is important for effectively using static methods in Java.



Can static methods be overridden in Java? Explain why or why not.

✅ Answer: No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java. They are associated with the class itself, not objects, and are resolved at compile-time based on the reference type. Instead, static methods can be hidden when defined in a subclass with the same signature.
What is the difference between overriding and method hiding in Java?

✅ Answer: Overriding applies to instance methods and allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method in the superclass. It uses dynamic binding (runtime). Method hiding, on the other hand, occurs with static methods, which are resolved at compile-time based on the reference type.
What happens if you define a static method in a subclass with the same signature as a static method in the superclass?

✅ Answer: This results in method hiding, not overriding. The static method in the subclass will hide the static method of the superclass, and the method call is resolved based on the reference type, not the actual object.
What is the output of the following code?

java
Copy code
class A {
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Class A display()");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Class B display()");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new B();
        obj.display();
    }
}
✅ Answer: The output is Class A display() because static methods are resolved based on the reference type A, not the actual object type B.
Advanced Questions:
What happens when you declare a static method and an instance method with the same signature in the subclass?

✅ Answer: It will result in a compilation error because a method cannot be both static and non-static in the same class hierarchy.
Is it possible to call a static method using an object reference in Java? If yes, does it follow runtime polymorphism?

✅ Answer: Yes, a static method can be called using an object reference, but this is discouraged because static methods are resolved at compile-time based on the reference type, not the actual object. Thus, it does not follow runtime polymorphism.

  Can static methods be abstract in Java? Why or why not?

✅ Answer: No, static methods cannot be abstract in Java because abstract methods are meant to be overridden by subclasses, and static methods are not subject to overriding. Abstract methods rely on instances, whereas static methods do not.
What is the output of the following code?

java
Copy code
class Parent {
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent static method");
    }
    public void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("Parent instance method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public static void display() {
        System.out.println("Child static method");
    }
    public void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("Child instance method");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
        obj.instanceMethod();
    }
}
✅ Answer: The output is:
sql
Copy code
Parent static method
Child instance method
Explanation: obj.display() calls the static method from Parent (due to method hiding, resolved at compile-time). However, obj.instanceMethod() follows runtime polymorphism and calls the Child's instance method.
Can you make both a static method and a non-static method with the same signature in a class?

✅ Answer: No, Java does not allow having both a static and a non-static method with the same signature in the same class because it would cause ambiguity in method resolution.
Why is it a bad practice to call a static method using an object reference?

✅ Answer: Calling a static method using an object reference can be misleading, as static methods are resolved at compile-time based on the class of the 
  reference type, not the object type. This can cause confusion when reading the code, leading to incorrect assumptions about runtime behavior.


how can we access sstatic method

In Java, static methods belong to the class rather than instances (objects) of the class.
As a result, static methods are typically accessed using the class name, but they can also be accessed using an object reference (though this is discouraged).
  Here’s how to access static methods:
